# 🎓 edu-vision-action-detection  
*A PyTorch–powered computer-vision model for detecting observable classroom actions*

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a modular deep-learning pipeline that detects **observable student actions** from classroom images — such as:

- ✍️ writing
- 🧑‍🏫 looking at board / attention-direction
- ✋ hand raised
- 📱 device visible (phone / laptop)

**No mental-state prediction** is performed — only **objective, physically observable actions.**

The project is part of a long-term roadmap toward building data-driven educational tools and **will later integrate as a micro-service** into a larger “Teacher Assistant Dashboard” ecosystem.
